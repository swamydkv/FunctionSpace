### Readme file

To run code:
* Download the baggage_problem.py file
* Command "./baggage_problem <arg>" where arg is no of baggages
	* Ex: _"./baggage_problem 5"_
* The code doesn't work for all inputs, I have given the output for inputs 3 to 99, where you will come to know which all are passing. Can check in the output file named output_baggage_problem.md
